The automated collection of SBI TT Rates serves as a critical infrastructure for Indian taxpayers (specifically for **Schedule FA** and **Schedule VDA** disclosures).

Special thanks to the original author for automating the preservation of these rates, which are otherwise notoriously difficult to retrieve after 24 hours.
